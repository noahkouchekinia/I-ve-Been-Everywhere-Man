# _I've Been Everywhere_ Data Analysis
This directory extracts and analyzes place names from Johnny Cash's rendition of _I've been Everywhere_.

**./I-ve_Been_Everywhere.Rmd** contains all code and analysis. It is is a heavily annotated file, so is mostly self explanatory.

**./I-ve_Been_Everywhere.html** is the formatted/published version of **./I-ve_Been_Everywhere.Rmd**.

**./index.html** is a copy of **./I-ve_Been_Everywhere.html**, renamed such that GitHub Pages recognizes and displays it [here](https://noahkouchekinia.github.io/I-ve_Been_Everywhere/).

**./publish.R** a utility script to process  **./I-ve_Been_Everywhere.Rmd** into **./I-ve_Been_Everywhere.html** and **./index.html**.

**./Data/** contains data used in the analysis. This includes the lyrics of _I've been Everywhere_ as a text file, and some county level statistics used in a attempt to model where Johnny Cash goes. 

**./Shapefiles/**  contains shape files of countries and states used to make where Johnny Cash went.
